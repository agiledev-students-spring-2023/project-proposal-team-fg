### Project title
FitGram

### What and why?
FitGram is a social media platform for people that work out. Users can log in, save workout routine presets, and share a post when they go to the gym containing the routine that they followed. The app will keep track of a user's "FitStreak", the number of days they have been working out.

This app will allow people to share and see each others routines and also motivate themselves to continue working out.

Maybe you have a really good pump at the gym and want the world to see - FitGram will let you share it!

Or maybe your current routine isn't working out for you too well - FitGram will let you see what other people's routines look like for some inspiration.

### For whom?
This software is intended to be used by young adults / adults who go to the gym and enjoy making posts on social media and sharing pictures of themselves.

### How?
A young adult can register or login to an account on the site.  They have the ability to create and view posts and preset routines. Routines are lists of exercises (and optionally, a number of sets, reps, and weight for each exercise). When creating posts, they can add photos, videos, and text as well as an option to link their workout routine. When viewing posts, they can interact by commenting, liking, and saving posts. They also have the option to save just the routine linked to posts for their convenience. The app will provide a "FitScore" that increases based on how much the user posts on the app and interacts with other users. Users will also be able to search for and view other user's profiles, as well as their own. Their profiles will show their FitScore as well as all the posts they've made, along with some personal information (like a bio).  Users can also add other Users as friends allowing for a personalized feed.

### Scope
This project is a pretty standard social media website project using the MERN stack, so it should definitely be doable within the scope of a semester, even for people new to the MERN stack. However, it also includes features like image / video upload, multiple pages, and dynamic forms, which will make the project complex enough to be worthwhile and challenging.
